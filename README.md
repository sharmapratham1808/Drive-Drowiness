# Drive Drowiness Machine Learning web app projet



# Description:
Developed a machine
learning application that uses face
recognition to monitor a user's face and
triggers an alarm when it detects that the
user is sleeping.

# Technologies Used:
Python, OpenCV,
Haar Cascade Classifier

# Key Features:
# Real-Time Face Detection:
Continuously
scans and identifies the user's face using the
Haar Cascade algorithm.
# Sleep Detection:
Monitors eye closure
and other facial cues to determine if the
user is asleep.
# Alarm System:
Triggers an audible alarm
to wake the user when sleep is detected.
